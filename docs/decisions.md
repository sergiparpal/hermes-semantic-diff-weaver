# Decisions and compatibility record

## MVP fixed decisions

- Configuration is optional and conservative defaults provide first-run output.
- Evidence is batched by module under per-call bounds and an eight-call total ceiling.
- Low-confidence material risk is presented as a review question; below-threshold findings become
  visible omissions/limitations.
- Exact names, Git rename metadata, signatures, normalized fingerprints, and conservative similarity
  support symbol matching without forced ambiguous matches.
- Deterministic fallback is enabled by default.
- Stable behavior fingerprints plus low materiality classify refactors; otherwise the strongest
  supported category or `unknown_semantic_change` is used.
- The handler always returns JSON text, including Markdown-only mode.
- The user's active Hermes provider/model/profile is used without routing overrides.
- The plugin registers one standalone tool and no hooks, commands, skills, or overrides.

## Compatibility snapshot (2026-07-17)

- Local bundled test runtime: CPython 3.12.13 on Windows.
- Local Git: 2.54.0.windows.1.
- Hermes Agent was not installed in the local runtime, so no local runtime version or signature was
  claimed.
- Current official Hermes sources reported Hermes Agent 0.14.0 with Python `>=3.11`.
- `PluginContext.register_tool` accepts `name`, `toolset`, `schema`, `handler`, optional checks/env,
  async/description/emoji fields, and `override=False`.
- `PluginLlm.complete_structured` accepts `instructions`, typed `input`, `json_schema`, `schema_name`,
  request shaping (`temperature`, `max_tokens`, `timeout`, `purpose`), and gated routing overrides.
  This plugin supplies no provider, model, agent, or profile override.
- Directory and pip entry-point discovery remain opt-in; project plugins require
  `HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS`.

The lowest compatible Hermes release is intentionally not guessed. A fake-context contract suite and
wheel entry-point smoke test are release gates; real Hermes discovery runs when a compatible runtime
is present.

## Release note

No license has been invented. Publication remains blocked on an explicit licensing decision, while
local builds and tests are unaffected.

## Evaluation label review (2026-07-17)

The retry-predicate fixture originally listed `state_transition_change` even though its increment
statement was identical at both revisions. The expected label was removed after the required separate
fixture review so evaluation does not reward an unsupported state-change finding.
